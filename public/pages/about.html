<h1>About QA Ticks and Crosses</h1>
<p>
  We used to have the ability in WebEx Training for learners to send us ticks, crosses and other emojis.
  In WebEx Meetings no such feature exists. This web app aims to fill that gap.
</p>
<p>For an introduction on how to use this application, <a href="https://youtu.be/B3pryomrHwc" target="_blank">see this video</a> (6 mins).</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>
  This application has been developed by Andrew Burgess, a tutor at QA, in his spare time.
  It is not supported by QA support desk or any other function within QA. If something goes wrong,
  Andrew will try to help, but doing so will always be a lower priority than him delivering a course.
  Suggestions for improvements are always welcome.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to see how the application works, the
  <a href="https://github.com/ajburgess/ticks-and-crosses" target="_blank">source code</a>
  is available on GitHub.
  You could even fork a copy of the application's code, make your own changes,
  and send Andrew a pull request to have them included in the live version if you'd like.
